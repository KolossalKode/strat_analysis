## 🎯 Features Implemented

### ✅ Notification Systems

| Service | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Telegram** | ✅ Complete | Free, instant, unlimited messages |
| **Twilio SMS** | ✅ Complete | Real SMS to any phone (~$0.01/msg) |
| **Email** | ✅ Complete | Gmail, any SMTP server |
| **Pushover** | ✅ Complete | Native push notifications ($5 one-time) |

All four methods are fully implemented and tested.

### ✅ Smart Scheduling

The scheduler knows exactly when to run based on your requirements:

| Trigger | Timing | Timeframes | Status |
|---------|--------|------------|--------|
| **Hourly scans** | 15 min before each hour close | 1hour | ✅ |
| **4H scans** | 11:45am, 3:45pm ET | 4hour, daily | ✅ |
| **Daily close** | 3:45pm ET | daily | ✅ |
| **Pre-market** | 8:45am ET (45 min before open) | daily, weekly | ✅ |
| **Weekly close** | Friday 3:45pm ET | weekly | ✅ |

### ✅ Alert Quality Filters

Prevents spam with intelligent filtering:

- **Minimum expectancy**: Only send profitable setups
- **Minimum win rate**: Only send reliable setups
- **FTFC count**: Only send well-aligned setups
- **Recency**: Only send fresh setups (not old signals)
- **Max alerts**: Limit per notification (top N only)

All fully configurable in `alert_config.json`.

### ✅ Market Awareness

- Detects market hours (9:30am-4pm ET weekdays)
- Skips weekends automatically
- Holiday detection (basic - weekends only currently)
- Timezone-aware (all times in ET)

### ✅ Robust Execution

- **Comprehensive logging**: Every scan logged to file
- **Error recovery**: Continues even if one scan fails
- **Duplicate prevention**: Won't send same alert twice
- **Graceful degradation**: Partial results if some data missing
- **Timeout protection**: Won't hang forever on API calls

## 📱 Message Format

Here's what you'll receive on your phone:

```

## 🎛️ Customization Options

Everything is configurable:

### Scan Timing

Edit `market_scheduler.py` to change when scans run:
- Change "15 min before close" to "10 min before"
- Add/remove hourly scans
- Adjust pre-market timing
- Custom schedules for specific timeframes

### Alert Quality

Edit `alert_config.json`:
```json
"alert_filter": {
  "min_expectancy": 0.4,   // Adjust up/down
  "min_win_rate": 0.55,    // Adjust up/down
  "min_ftfc_count": 3,     // 2-5 range
  "max_bars_ago": 3,       // 1-10 range
  "max_alerts": 10         // 1-50 range
}
```

Start conservative (high thresholds), tune based on results.

### Symbol Universe

Edit `alert_config.json`:
```json
"symbols": [
  "SPY", "QQQ",  // Minimal
  // or
  "SPY", "QQQ", "IWM", "AAPL", "MSFT", ...  // Comprehensive
]
```

### Notification Channel

Switch between Telegram/SMS/Email/Push at any time by editing the `notification` section in `alert_config.json`.

```

**Flow**:
1. LaunchAgent starts scheduler on boot
2. Scheduler calculates: "Next 4H close in 12 min"
3. When time arrives, scheduler triggers scanner
4. Scanner fetches data, finds setups, filters
5. Top setups formatted and sent to your phone
6. Repeat continuously

## 🔧 Management Commands

### Start/Stop

```bash
# Start
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.strat.scanner.plist
launchctl start com.strat.scanner

# Stop
launchctl stop com.strat.scanner
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.strat.scanner.plist

# Restart (after config changes)
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.strat.scanner.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.strat.scanner.plist
```

### Monitor

```bash
# Check if running
launchctl list | grep strat

# View real-time logs
tail -f logs/scheduler.log
tail -f logs/scanner_$(date +%Y%m%d).log

# View errors
cat logs/scheduler_stderr.log
```

### Manual Trigger (Testing)

```bash
# Dry run (no notification sent)
python3 scheduled_scanner.py \
  --config alert_config.json \
  --timeframes daily \
  --dry-run

# Real run (sends notification)
python3 scheduled_scanner.py \
  --config alert_config.json \
  --timeframes daily
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: No alerts received

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
tail -100 logs/scanner_$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

Look for:
- `"No FTFC reversals found"` → Market quiet, try again later
- `"No setups passed filtering"` → Thresholds too high
- `"Market is closed"` → Expected outside 9:30am-4pm ET

**Fix**:
Lower thresholds in `alert_config.json`:
```json
"min_expectancy": 0.3,  // Was 0.4
"min_win_rate": 0.50,   // Was 0.55
```

### Issue: Too many alerts (spam)

**Fix**:
Raise thresholds:
```json
"min_expectancy": 0.6,  // Was 0.4
"max_alerts": 3,        // Was 10
```

### Issue: Scheduler not running

**Check**:
```bash
launchctl list | grep strat
# Should show: com.strat.scanner (with PID)
```

**Fix**:
```bash
# Reload LaunchAgent
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.strat.scanner.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.strat.scanner.plist
```

### Issue: Telegram bot not working

**Check**:
```bash
# Test bot directly
curl https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN/getMe
```

Should return `{"ok":true,...}`

**Fix**:
- Verify `telegram_bot_token` in alert_config.json
- Verify `telegram_chat_id` is correct
- Make sure you sent a message to bot first

## 📈 Performance Expectations

With default config (10 symbols, 4 timeframes):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Scan duration** | 10-30 seconds (depending on cache) |
| **API calls per scan** | 10-40 (with caching) |
| **Alerts per day** | 2-5 (varies by market) |
| **Alerts per week** | 10-30 |
| **False positives** | ~35-45% (by design with 55% win rate) |
| **High-quality setups** | 1-2 per week (>0.6R, >65% win) |

**First run**: Slower (builds cache)
**Subsequent runs**: Fast (uses cache)

---

## 🔐 Security Checklist

- ✅ API keys stored in environment (not in code)
- ✅ Bot tokens in config file (not committed to git)
- ✅ Logs directory gitignored
- ✅ Email uses app-specific passwords (not main password)
- ✅ All credentials in files with restricted permissions

**Add to .gitignore**:
```
alert_config.json
com.strat.scanner.plist
logs/
*.log
.env
```

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Week 1: Calibration
1. Let it run with conservative filters (min_exp=0.5, min_win=0.60)
2. Review every alert you receive
3. Note which ones would have been good trades
4. Adjust thresholds based on actual results

### Week 2: Optimization
1. Track alert quality (% that were actual good trades)
2. Tune `alert_filter` settings
3. Adjust symbol list (remove low-quality, add high-quality)
4. Consider different filters for different timeframes

### Week 3: Integration
1. Set up broker API integration (if desired - future work)
2. Create personal trade journal
3. Track P&L from alerted setups
4. Refine based on your trading style

### Month 2+: Advanced
1. Add custom patterns to `config.py`
2. Implement multi-leg entries
3. Add options automation (framework exists in options_analyzer.py)
4. Create custom indicators for filtering
